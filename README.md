# Dark Sounds Restored
Windows 11 introduced a refreshed system soundscape that rounded out the harsher-sounding tones found throughout Windows 10. 

What you may not know is that Microsoft intended for the light and dark themes to use different sounds; the built-in dark theme is supposed to use tweaked sounds that are calmer, more gentle in comparison to the default soundscape. Microsoft refers to these as "Light Sounds" and "Dark Sounds."

>"We introduced light and dark sound options so that people who may have low visibility or no vision can still experience light and dark themes audibly. Themed sounds improve productivity by matching your working style through your theme. Dark Sounds help you stay in focus while Light Sounds ensure youâ€™re always engaged" - [Microsoft spokesperson.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-11-dark-mode-has-quieter-more-soothing-sounds-listen-now/)
 
Somewhere along the way this functionality broke (or maybe it was never set up properly to begin with?). This theme pack will restore the proper sounds by installing a new **Windows (Dark Sounds)** theme on to your system.

# Requirements

Windows 11, naturally. Any version should work, but this has only been tested on 23H2.

# Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/litbeep/Windows-Dark-Sounds-Fix/releases/download/release/theme.zip) from this repository.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Double-click **Windows (Dark Sounds).theme**.
4. The theme will automatically be applied and you will now be able to hear the correct sounds throughout the system.

# Post-installation

If you Windows to automatically switch to this theme on a schedule, here's a shameless plug for the [AutoDarkMode](https://github.com/AutoDarkMode/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode) app. I am not associated with the project but it works extremely well.
