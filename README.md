# Windows Dark Sounds Fix
Windows 11 introduced a refreshed system sound scheme that is much less grating on the ears. What many people don't know is that Microsoft intended for the light and dark themes to use different sounds; the built-in dark theme is supposed to use tweaked sounds that are more gentle in comparison to the default scheme. 
 
However, somewhere along the way this functionality broke (or maybe it was never set up properly to begin with?). This theme pack will restore the proper sounds by installing a new **Windows (dark - fixed)** theme on to your system.

# Requirements

Windows 11, naturally. Any version should work, but this has only been tested on 23H2.

# Installation

2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Double-click **Windows (dark - fixed).theme**.
4. The theme will automatically be applied and you will now be able to hear the correct sounds throughout the system.
